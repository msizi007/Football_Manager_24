# Statistics (Goal Predictions) - Poisson Distribution
- Excell might be helpful for calculations of the distribution

Calculation:

Req:
- number of goals scored (home)
- number of goals conceded (home)
- number of goals scored (away)
- number of goals conceded (away)

goals_scored_per_game (home) [rate] = umber of goals scored (home) / number of games played (home)
ETC {4..}

avaraga goals scored & concerded (home & away)

calc attacking & defensive strength (home & away)
attacking strength = goals_scored_per_game / avarage goals scored per game (league)
ETC {4..}

pull out attacking and defensive strength of fixture teams

expected_goals(home_team) [floor]= attacking strength (home) * defensive strength (away) *
     avarage goals scored per game (home)
expected_goals(home_team) [floor]= attacking strength (away) * defensive strength (home) *
     avarage goals scored per game (away)
